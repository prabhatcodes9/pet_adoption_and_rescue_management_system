    <h2>Adoption Guidelines</h2>
    <p>
      At <span class="highlight">PetConnect</span>, we ensure that every adoption is handled with care, transparency, and proper legal verification.
      The following guidelines explain how the adoption process works for rescued and found pets.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>🐕‍🦺 If any pet is <span class="highlight">found by a user</span> and remains without an owner for <b>15 days</b>, the pet becomes eligible for <span class="highlight">adoption</span>.</li>
      <li>🐾 Such pets are verified and listed by PetConnect as <b>ready for adoption</b>.</li>
      <li>📞 When a user makes an adoption request, they receive a <span class="highlight">verification call</span> from PetConnect to confirm their details and intent.</li>
      <li>📋 After the necessary <span class="highlight">legal procedures</span> and documentation, the pet is officially handed over to its new owner.</li>
      <li>❤️ PetConnect ensures every pet is adopted into a safe, loving, and responsible home.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Thank you for choosing to adopt, not shop. Every adoption helps give an animal a second chance at happiness.
